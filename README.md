# Hope in a Box (Static Demo)

**Live Demo:** [https://gailchg.github.io/Hope_Static/](https://gailchg.github.io/Hope_Static/)

## ℹ️ Overview
This repository contains the **Static HTML/CSS Version** of the "Hope in a Box" web application.

Because **GitHub Pages** does not support server-side languages like PHP or database connections (MySQL), this version serves as a **frontend design showcase**. It demonstrates the user interface, responsiveness, and layout of the project without the dynamic data processing.

## 🚧 Static Mode Limitations
* **No Database Connection:** Dynamic features (e.g., calculating donation totals, tracking live volunteer slots) are simulated or hard-coded.
* **Forms Disabled:** The "Contact Us", "Donate", and "Volunteer" forms do not submit data.
* **Static Buttons:** Clicking "View Details" or "Volunteer" buttons will trigger a pop-up alert explaining that the feature requires a live database connection.

To view the **fully functional dynamic version** with a working database, please visit our live deployment on InfinityFree:

## 🎨 Features Showcased
* **Hero Section:** Responsive banner with call-to-action buttons.
* **Sticky Navigation:** Header remains fixed while scrolling.
* **Tabbed Interface:** JavaScript-powered switching between Events and Programs.
* **Responsive Grid:** Event and Donation cards stack vertically on mobile devices.
* **Split-Layout Contact Page:** Functional UI design for the contact section.

## 📂 Technologies
* **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)
* **CSS3** (Custom Variables, Flexbox, Media Queries)
* **JavaScript** (DOM Manipulation for Tabs and Alerts)
